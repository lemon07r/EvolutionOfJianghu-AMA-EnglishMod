我随便练练就能一个打十个；给我<color=red>{0}金</color>，我就是贵派的人了！¤I can beat ten people with just a little practice; give me <color=red>{0} gold</color> and I'll be a member of your school!
太好了！我定助本门一统江湖！¤Great! I will help our school to unify the world!
咱们门派中再见！¤See you in the sect!
哈哈哈哈~我也能学习绝世武功了！¤I can learn the best martial arts too!
他们都不如我，不用考虑了！¤They're all inferior to me, so don't even think about it!
我资质过人¤I'm gifted!
我天赋异禀¤I'm gifted。
我能吃苦耐劳¤I can work hard。
我吃得少¤I eat less
何事？¤What is it?
莫来扰我清静。¤Do not come to disturb my peace and quiet.
来此作甚？¤What are you doing here?
尽是些不成器的崽子。¤You're just a bunch of untalented kids.
罢了罢了。¤That's all.
真是麻烦。¤What a nuisance.
督促弟子勤加修炼！¤Tell your disciples to train harder!
何人？¤Who is it?
在下来抓一名<color=#E73434>{0}</color>的叛徒。¤I'm here to catch a <color=#E73434>{0}</color> traitor.
额呵呵...原来如此...我...我也是来抓叛徒的。¤Uh huh... So that's how it is... I... I'm also here to catch the traitor.
此人面色惶恐，说话结结巴巴，额头隐隐渗出汗水，看来是在撒谎。¤This person's face was terrified, his words stuttered, and sweat was faintly seeping out of his forehead, so he seemed to be lying.
我看过这名叛徒的画像，就是你！¤I've seen this traitor's portrait, and it's you!
啊！我没有，我只是阻止他们赶尽杀绝，放跑了几个山匪，我...¤Ah! I didn't, I just stopped them from rushing out and letting a few mountain bandits go, I...
果然是此人，你只是稍微一诈此人便立马承认了。¤Sure enough, it was this person, you immediately admitted it after just a slight swindle of this person.
阁下还是跟我回去，跟你的师门解释吧。¤You'd better come back with me and explain to your master.
不！我跟你拼了！¤No! I will fight with you!
你三下五除二的将此人五花大绑，但是此人嘴里却没闲着。¤You tied this person up in three strokes, but this person's mouth was not idle.
放开我！阁下不要为<color=#E73434>{0}</color>做事，这些自诩名门大派，绝大多数都无侠义可言。¤Let go of me! Your Excellency do not work for <color=#E73434>{0}</color>, the vast majority of these self-proclaimed famous sects have no chivalry to speak of.
在下数月前奉师门之命去讨伐山匪，攻入山寨中后发现那些不过是走投无路的普通山民而已。¤I was ordered by my master to crush the mountain bandits a few months ago, and after attacking the mountain fortress, I found that those were just ordinary mountain people who had no way out.
而一行的其他同门却要将山寨中老弱妇孺全部屠戮一空，说是师名不可违。¤But the other members of my party wanted to slaughter all the old and weak women and children in the fortress, saying that the master's name must not be disobeyed.
于是我便动手阻止了他们，寨中山匪也都放跑了。¤So I stopped them, and the bandits in the fortress were let go.
返回师门后他们便打算诬陷我串通包庇山匪。¤After returning to the division, they intended to accuse me of conspiring to harbor the bandits.
我百口莫辩，为避免大祸只好逃走...你帮他们等于是在助纣为虐啊！¤I couldn't defend myself, so I had to run away to avoid a big disaster... You're helping them, you're helping the enemy!
他说完后见你依然表情默然，随后便面若死灰只能接受命运的安排。¤After he finished, he saw that you still look silent, and then ashen face can only accept the fate of the arrangement.
此人功夫果然了得，你竟敌不过。¤This man's kung fu is really good, you can not defeat.
阁下不要再助纣为虐，好自为之。¤You should not help the enemy and do your best.
阁下有何赐教？¤What do you want to tell me?
阁下是何人？¤Who are you?
让开!否则别怪我不客气！¤Get out of the way! Otherwise don't blame me for being rude!
原来是{0}{1},真是巧！没想到在这里能遇见。¤So it's {0}{1}, what a coincidence! I didn't expect to meet here。
哈哈哈！原来是{0}{1},这是要去哪儿啊。¤Hahahaha! So it's {0}{1}, where are you going?
{0}{1},好久不见！¤{0}{1}, long time no see!
是你啊！有事吗？¤It's you! What's up?
抱歉,在下还要赶路。¤I'm sorry, I have to hurry。
江湖险恶,在下不想与人随意结交。¤I don't want to make friends with people in the world。
你我非同道中人,话不投机!¤You and I are not in the same line of work, we don't speak well together!
长相如此丑陋之人,也妄想与我等结识！¤How can someone so ugly want to get acquainted with us?
阁下相貌惊人,在下胆小,还是各走各路吧。¤You look amazing, I am timid, let's go our separate ways。
原来如此,在下{0},不知阁下如何称呼。¤I see, I'm {0}, I don't know what you call yourself。
能多认识朋友,那真是太好不过！¤It would be great to meet more friends!
阁下仪表不凡,能结识一番是在下的荣幸。¤I'm honored to meet you。
姑娘美若天仙,在下求之不得。¤The girl is as beautiful as a fairy, I can't wait to meet you。
姑娘生得如此俊俏,自然得认识一下。¤You are so handsome, so I must get to know you。
还有指教吗？¤Do you have any advice?
最近练功有不少体会,正好我们交流交流。¤Recently, I've learned a lot from practicing Martial Arts, so let's exchange ideas。
听说有人在附近得到个不得了的宝贝,也不知道是真是假。¤I heard that someone got a great treasure nearby, I don't know if it's true or not。
我听说些人可以把功法练到大圆满境界！简直是天才！¤I've heard that some people can practice their Martial Arts to the great perfection state! It's a genius!
你们门派有没有漂亮妹子？介绍介绍呗。¤Do you have any pretty girls in your sect? The first thing you should do is to introduce them。
{0}{1},以咱们的交情,能成为同门是最好不过!¤{0}{1},I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to get the best out of you。
既然{0}{1}这样说必然不会错,我同意加入！¤Since {0}{1} said so, I agree to join!
有门派庇护当然更好,我同意加入{0}{1}的门派。¤I agree to join {0}{1}'s sect。
{0}{1},虽然你这样说,但是我目前还不想加入贵派,真是抱歉。¤{0}{1}, although you say so, but I do not want to join your faction at the moment, really sorry。
我目前觉得挺好的,多谢{0}{1}美意。¤I think it's fine for now, thanks to {0}{1}'s kind words。
非常抱歉,{0}{1},这件事情恐怕还需要从长计议。¤I'm very sorry, {0}{1}, but I'm afraid we'll have to think about this for a long time。
好啊！我最近功力大进,正想找人试试手,来吧！¤Good! I've recently improved my power and I'm looking for someone to try my hand at it, so come on!
哈哈！找我练手来了吗?来吧,陪你玩玩。¤Come on! You're looking for me to practice? Come on, I'll play with you。
刀剑无眼,还是算了吧。¤Swords have no eyes, so forget it。
什么！光天化日你居然敢如此！¤What? How dare you do that in broad daylight!
哈哈哈！向来是我抢别人,被人抢还是第一次！¤Hahahaha! I've always robbed others, but this is the first time I've been robbed!
好！你等着,我知道你是{0}的人！¤Good! Wait, I know you're the one with {0}!
{0}是我无意间获得,我拿来无用,就赠与你。¤{0}I got it by accident, so I'll give it to you。
城中酒馆是主要的消息传播途径，谣言想必也是通过酒馆散布出去的。¤The city's taverns are the main way of spreading news, and rumors must have been spread through them.
这位大侠，您想吃点啥？¤This warrior, what would you like to eat?
一壶好酒，三斤牛肉。¤A pot of good wine and three pounds of beef.
好勒~您请稍后。¤Okay, please wait.
你装作一名普通的江湖客，慢条斯理的喝酒吃肉，但实则凝其耳韵仔细分辨着酒馆内其他客人的谈话内容。¤You pretend to be an ordinary jianghu customer, slowly and methodically drinking and eating meat, but actually condensing its ear rhyme to carefully distinguish the content of the conversation of other customers in the tavern.
不一会<color=#E73434>{0}</color>三个字突然落入耳中，你寻声看去。¤The three words <color=#E73434>{0}</color> suddenly fall into your ears, and you look for the sound.
只见不远处有一桌三人，你一言我一语的说着，而且声情并茂，仿佛生怕附近的人注意不到他们似的。¤You can see a table of three people not far away, you say one thing and I say another, and the voice is very strong, as if afraid that the people nearby will not notice them.
哎~你知道吗，<color=#E73434>{0}</color>的掌门其实已经死了，最近刚刚继任的掌门是个女的。¤Hey ~ did you know that the <color=#E73434>{0}</color>'s headmaster has actually died, and the one who just recently succeeded him is a woman.
啊？还有这等大事，没听说啊。¤What? There is such a big deal, I didn't hear about it.
嗐，这你就不知道了，<color=#E73434>{0}</color>担心门派地位下降，不敢公开消息。¤The <color=#E73434>{0}</color> is worried about the decline in the status of the sect and does not dare to disclose the news.
这还不打紧，重要的是刚继任的这位女掌门和门下男弟子乱搞，听说肚子都给搞大了，这下更不敢公开消息了...¤It doesn't matter, but the important thing is that the newly appointed female head of the sect and the male disciples under the discipline to mess around, I heard that the belly are to get pregnant, now even more afraid to disclose the news...
听到这你已经确认便是这几人在撒布谣言了，你缓步来到三人桌前。¤Hearing this you have confirmed that these people are spreading rumors, you slowly step to the table of three.
三位，我这有个秘密消息告诉你们。¤Three, I have a secret message for you.
你俯下身，用只有他们三人能听见的声音悄悄说道。¤You leaned down and said quietly in a voice that only the three of them could hear.
其实我就是你们口中和女掌门乱搞的男弟子。¤In fact, I am the male disciple that you say is messing around with the female Sect Leader.
其实我就是那名刚继任的女掌门。¤In fact, I am the female Sect Leader who has just succeeded to the post.
三人听到你的话后一愣。¤The three of them froze when they heard your words.
你不等三人反应，用未出鞘的武器一把抽在其中一人脸上，先动手了。¤You didn't wait for the three to react, and used the unsheathed weapon to whip one of them in the face with a hand and strike first.
啊！可恶！¤Ah! Damn it!
以后再到处胡言乱语，死路一条！¤If you go around talking nonsense in the future, you will die!
三人捂着脸，一边称是一边跑掉了。¤The three men covered their faces and ran away while saying yes.
狗日的敢打我兄弟，以后别让我看见你。¤Don't let me see you again.
你被扔出了酒馆之外。¤You were thrown out of the tavern.
此处山谷云山雾罩神秘异常,深入其中还需格外小心。¤This valley is covered with clouds and fog mysteriously, deep in which you also need to be extra careful。
这么大的雾说不定会有什么奇遇宝贝，你一边摸索着一边前进。¤Such a big fog may have some strange encounter treasure, you feel while moving forward。
前方雾气渐渐散了，你看到有人影奔来。¤The fog ahead gradually dispersed, you see a human figure running。
什么人！闯到我们营地来了，真是不知死活，弄死他！¤What a man! He's barging into our camp, he doesn't know what he's doing, kill him!
你把冲上来的山贼杀了个一干二净，剩下的山贼纷纷逃往深山了。¤You killed all the bandits who came up to you, and the rest of them fled to the mountains。
你见状没有理会那些逃跑的山贼，走到山贼窝藏物资的地方，挑了一些能用的，都带走了。¤You saw the situation ignored those fleeing mountain bandits, walked to the place where the mountain bandits hid supplies, picked some that could be used and took them all away。
这里的山贼实力异常强大，双拳难敌四手。你抽了个空，大喝一声，然后转身逃跑了。¤The mountain bandits here are unusually strong, and two fists can't beat four hands。 You drew a blank, shouted, and then turned to escape。
前方雾气渐淡，你发现不远处有一个石洞，直觉告诉自己这洞中可能不简单。¤The fog ahead fades and you find a stone cave not far away, your intuition tells you that the cave may not be simple。
你戒备着进入到石洞之中，发现其内部空空如也，但是发现在洞壁之上刻画着一些动作，仿佛是一套功法。¤You enter the stone cave on guard and find its interior empty, but find some movements carved on top of the cave walls, as if it were a set of gongfu。
于是你拿出自己的武器照着上面的动作练习起来。¤So you take out your own weapon and practice the movements on it。
你逐渐熟练这些动作之后心里暗自惊叹，这些动作玄妙异常，无论是刀法还是剑法皆能施展，并且威力不俗。¤You gradually become proficient in these movements and then marveled in your heart, these movements are subtle and unusual, both Blade and sword techniques can be performed, and the power is not bad。
你感觉差不多便收拾东西离开了此处，刚离开没多远，忽然雾气翻滚，哪里还有之前石洞的踪影。¤You felt that it was almost time to pack up and leave this place, just a short distance away, suddenly the fog rolled over, where there was no trace of the previous stone cave。
有此奇遇自己真是幸运，你继续向前，并未多时便走出了山谷。¤You were lucky to have this encounter, you continued forward and did not have much time to get out of the valley。
你正摸索前进，突然脚下一滑，下面是个悬崖。你伸手往两旁抓了一下，什么都没有抓到，四周都是云雾看不清楚，你只能坠落悬崖。¤You were feeling your way forward when suddenly your feet slipped and there was a cliff below。 You reached out to the sides and grabbed, nothing, surrounded by clouds and fog can not see clearly, you can only fall off the cliff。
噗通一声，你摔倒一个水潭，你赶紧游上去，爬到了谭边的一块大石头上。你看了看四周已经没有雾气了，除了水潭，到处都是树木。¤Poof, you fell into a pool of water, you hurriedly swim up and climbed to a large rock at the edge of the Tan。 You look around there is no longer fog, in addition to water pools, there are trees everywhere。
这时你突然看到对面的山崖上有不少猿猴，在陡峭山崖之间攀爬跳远闪转腾挪，这灵动无比的姿态，你一时间看呆了。¤At this time you suddenly saw a number of apes and monkeys on the opposite cliff, climbing and jumping between the steep cliffs, the incomparable posture of the spirit, you looked stunned for a time。
恍惚之间仿佛看到自己犹如腾云驾雾般在悬崖之间游走，你感觉你悟到了什么。<color=red>(身法获得提升)</color>¤The first thing you can do is to see yourself walking between the cliffs as if you were on a cloud, and you feel you have realized something。 <color=red>(Body Technique Gains Improvement)</color>
你无奈只能在崖底另外寻找出路，但幸运的是你发现在这与世隔绝之处，珍稀药草居然随处可见，你一路收集了不少。¤You have no choice but to find another way out at the bottom of the cliff, but luckily you find that rare herbs are actually everywhere in this isolated place, and you collect quite a few along the way。
获得:(<color=red>{0}</color>)¤Gain:(<color=red>{0}</color>)
这趟收获不小，你找了一条小路出来了。¤It's not a bad haul, and you find a path out。
前方雾气渐渐散了，你见前面有个水潭，谭边有个大石头，石头上有一人正在静坐修炼。¤The fog ahead is gradually dispersing and you see a pool of water in front of you, a large rock by the side of the tam, and a person on the rock is sitting in meditation and cultivation。
你仔细一瞧，此人蓬头垢面、披头散发。身着一身黑袍，瘦骨嶙峋的双手盘在怀中，周身黑气缭绕，仿佛在修炼什么邪功。¤You take a closer look, this person is disheveled, cloaked。 Dressed in a black robe, thin, bony hands coiled in the arms, surrounded by black gas, as if in the practice of any evil gong。
谁在那里！¤Who is there!
在下误打误撞来到此处，打扰到阁下练功，非常抱歉，这就离开。¤I came here by mistake and disturbed your practice, I am very sorry, I will leave now。
桀桀桀...别着急走啊，老子刚刚习得一门奇功，正好拿你来练练手！¤Jie Jie Jie... Don't be in a hurry to leave, I've just learned a strange technique, so I'll use you to practice!
话音刚落，此人鬼魅般的身影便扑了上来。¤As soon as the words left his mouth, this man's ghostly figure pounced on him。
阁下好功夫，咋们后会有期！¤You have good Martial Arts, we will meet again!
此人身法诡异，话音刚落，便已不见身影；但是刚才动手之时，见此人有一物品掉落一旁。¤This person's body style is strange, just as the words fall, they have disappeared; but just now when the action, see this person has an object dropped aside。
你上前一看，原来是一部叫{0}的功法。¤You went up to take a look and it turned out to be a gong method called {0}。
你将其收入怀中后找了一条小路出来了。¤You took it into your arms and found a path out。
对方一掌拍在你的身上，你自知不敌，直接借势飞退数丈后便施展身法迅速逃离。¤The other side of a slap on your body, you know you can not defeat, directly use the momentum to fly back a few feet and then cast a body technique to quickly escape。
还好对方并未追赶，只是在后方发出邪恶的狂笑之声，不久后你终于找到一条小路出来了。¤Fortunately, the other side did not chase after you, but only in the back of the evil maniacal laughter, soon after you finally found a path out。
虽然自己<color=red>未曾习得</color>任何身法，但你模仿了一阵它们的姿态，感觉身体仿佛也比以往灵巧不少。¤Although you <color=red>hadn't acquired</color> any body techniques, you imitated their posture for a while and felt as if your body was more dexterous than before。
欢迎各位大侠参加本次“大衍拍卖会”。¤Welcome to the 'Dayan Auction'.
在大衍各个商会的不懈努力下，终于又收罗到各式奇珍异宝。¤With the unremitting efforts of all the chambers of commerce in Dayan, we have finally found all kinds of exotic treasures.
各位英雄好汉可要看好了，老规矩“价高者得”！¤All heroes and heroines should pay attention to the old rule 'the highest bidder wins'!
废话不多说，“大衍拍卖会”正式开始！¤Without further ado, the 'Dayan Auction' officially begins!
在下是来自<color=red>{0}</color>的使者,贵派扣押了本门的弟子,不知是否可以将其释放,在下将代表本门万分感谢！¤I am an emissary from <color=red>{0}</color>, your sect has detained our disciples, I wonder if they can be released, I will be very grateful on behalf of our sect!
贵派果然深明大义！那在下就将人带走了,告辞。¤Your sect is indeed profoundly righteous! Then I will take the person away, goodbye。
这...既然如此,我会向本门如实禀报,此事恐不能善了了！告辞！¤This... In that case, I will report the truth to the sect, I am afraid this matter cannot be settled! Farewell!
哎...也罢！我派愿出<color=red>{0}</color>,来换回本门弟子,请贵派适可而止！¤Oh... I'll leave it at that. We are willing to offer <color=red>{0}</color> in exchange for our disciples, please stop!
赎金已交付,扣押的本门弟子在下就带走了,咱们后会有期！走！¤The ransom has been paid, I'll take our disciples with me, we'll meet again。 Let's go!
做人留一线,日后好相见！还忘贵派三思。¤We'll see each other later! I hope you will think twice。
可恶！快放了我！¤Damn it! Let me go now!
等我回去,一定找弟兄杀上你们山门！¤When I get back, I'll get my men to kill you!
大侠,你一路带着我这么累,还是放了我吧。¤You've brought me all the way here, so let me go。
这位好汉，在下<color=red>「{0}」·{1}</color>，不知可否将此物让于在下，就当大家交个朋友如何？¤This good man, I <color=red>'{0}'-{1}</color>, I wonder if you can let me have this item as a friend?
嗯？交朋友就不必了，我也需要此物，还是凭实力说话吧。¤I don't think so. I don't need to make friends, I need this too, let's talk about our strength.
哦？阁下既然开了这口，我也不能驳了阁下的面子，看其他竞争者愿不愿意吧。¤I don't need to be friends. Since you have made such an offer, I can't refute your face, let's see if the other competitors are willing.
既然阁下如此需要此物，自是不会继续相争，阁下出价便是。¤Since you need this item so much, you will not continue to compete, so you can bid.
原来如此，区区此物怎能比得上一位江湖朋友，在下退出竞价。¤I see, how can this mere object compare with a friend of the jianghu, I withdraw from the bidding.
这种荒郊野外恐怕是杀人越货的最佳场所。¤I'm afraid this is the best place to kill someone in the middle of nowhere。
你沿着小路继续向前走，打算穿过这片荒林。¤You continue along the path, intending to walk through this deserted forest。
然而刚进入不久，就隐隐听见有厮杀之声从前方不远处传来。¤However, shortly after entering, you faintly hear the sound of killing coming from a short distance ahead。
你不经加快步伐前行，很快就看到前方有两波人正在厮杀，看穿着打扮，应该是一帮马贼正在袭击一队镖师。¤You can't help but speed up your pace forward, and soon you see two waves of people ahead of you are killing each other。 Looking at the dress, it should be a group of horse thieves who are attacking a group of dart masters。
这群肮脏的马贼，镖师兄弟坚持一下，我们一起杀退这帮马贼。¤This group of dirty horse thieves, dart brothers hold on, let's kill back this group of horse thieves together。
嘿，还有这好事，让我也来参一手！¤Hey, there is this good thing, let me also participate!
你抬头望了望，吐了嘴里的柳枝，冷哼一声“与我何干”走开了。¤You looked up, spit out the willow branch in your mouth, and walked away with a cold snort of 'What's it to me?
你与镖师们联手终于将马贼杀退。¤You teamed up with the dart masters to finally kill the horse thieves。
感谢这位兄弟的舍命相救，没有你的话我们这几个命可就没了。¤Thanks to this brother's rescue, without you, we would have lost our lives。
路见不平，拔刀相助，不必客气。¤No need to be polite when you see injustice。
救命之恩岂能轻谢，这把{0}是我兄弟的遗物，他也用不上了，就送给阁下吧。¤This {0} is my brother's legacy, and he doesn't need it anymore, so I'll give it to you。
我们还要继续送镖，以后有需要可以来大衍城长风镖局找我，告辞。¤We have to continue to deliver the dart, if you need to come to me in the future, you can find me at the Long Wind Dart Station in Dayan City, goodbye。
马贼势大，你们都被冲散了，你看事不可为于是见机溜了。¤The horse thieves were so strong that you were all scattered, and you saw that things were not going to work out so you saw the opportunity to slip away。
哈哈哈哈~小子身手不错，有些钱粮我们拿不了太多，就送给你了，拿了快滚，别耽误咱们分宝贝！¤Hahahahaha ~ kid good hands, some money and food we can not take too much, so you give it to you, take it and get out, do not delay our share of the treasure!
这里的东西，我全都要！！¤The things here, I want them all!
你话音刚落，还不等众山贼反应便出手攻去。¤Your words just fell, and did not wait for the mountain bandits to react to attack。
你三拳头两脚便把这群马贼打跑了，抢到的东西也来不及带走，这下都是你的了。¤You three fists and two kicks will be this group of horse thieves fought away, grabbed the things too late to take away, now it's all yours。
你获得了金钱:<color=#CF2B21>{0}</color>，食物:<color=#CF2B21>{1}</color>，道具:{2}。¤You have gained Money:<color=#CF2B21>{0}</color>, Food:<color=#CF2B21>{1}</color>, and Props:{2}。
你收拾好战利品，继续前进，很快便走出了这片荒林，而在里面发生的事，永远没人知道。¤You pack up your loot and move on, and soon you are out of this barren forest, and what happens inside will never be known。
马贼凶狠强悍，你居然打不过，你找了个机会逃跑了。¤The horse thieves were so fierce and tough that you couldn't actually beat them, and you looked for an opportunity to escape。
这队镖师虽然人数不多但是个个身手奇高，你上前居然被对方三两下就打败了，只能灰头土脸的逃离了战场。¤This team of dart masters although not many but each of them has a strange skill, you went forward actually defeated by the other side in three or two blows, can only flee the battlefield in the dust。
你抬头望了望，吐了嘴里的柳枝，冷哼一声“与我何干”然后远远绕道离开了。¤You looked up, spit out the willow branch in your mouth, coldly grunted 'what does it matter to me' and left far away from the detour。
然而刚进入其中你便看到前方有两人，似乎正在争执什么。¤However, just entering it you saw two people in front of you, seemingly arguing about something。
{0}，你这是做怎么！为何要偷袭与我！¤{0}, you are doing how! Why did you sneak up on me!
{0}，你实力尚浅，<color=red>那些东西</color>放你这不安全，都交给我来保管吧！¤{0}, your strength is still shallow, <color=red>those things</color> are not safe for you to put here, let me keep them all!
哈哈哈！！可笑至极，眼红就直说！使什么下三滥手段。¤Hahahaha!!! You're laughable, just say so! The first thing you need to do is to say so。
是你自己找死，看剑！¤You're the one who wants to die, look at the sword!
说罢两人便动起手来，而且双方出手都毫无保留，招招致命，看来真的是要拼个你死我活了。¤The two said that they started to fight, and both sides have no reservations, deadly moves, it really seems to be a fight to the death。
世上竟有如此厚颜无耻之徒，看招！¤There is such a brazen person in the world, look at the moves!
对方见不敌我等，虚晃一枪之后，飞快窜入丛林之中，不见了身影。¤The other side, seeing that they were no match for us, after a false shot, scurried into the jungle and disappeared。
多谢阁下出手相救。¤Thank you for saving me。
这种无耻之徒，人人见尔诛之，不必言谢。¤This kind of shameless person, everyone will be killed, no need to say thank you。
他已对我起了杀心，从此恐再无宁日，若不嫌弃在下希望<color=red>加入阁下门派</color>效犬马之劳。¤If you don't mind, I would like to <color=red>join your sect</color> to serve you。
嗯，既然如此，那你就来我们门派吧。¤Well, if that's the case, then you can come to our sect。
太好了！我这就前往。¤Great! I will head there right away。
虽然如此，我也无法轻易同意此事，非常抱歉。¤Despite this, I cannot easily agree to this, and I am very sorry。
今日之事过后在下恐怕得浪迹江湖了，这些是我之前获得的，再留在身上恐怕会继续招来杀身之祸，阁下武艺高强，定能用得上。¤I'm afraid I'll have to wander the world after today's incident, these are the ones I acquired earlier, and I'm afraid I'll continue to incur the scourge of death if I stay on my body, you are a strong martial artist, you will be able to use them。
你获得道具:{0}。¤You get prop:{0}。
青山不改绿水长流，阁下后会有期!¤Green mountains do not change green water, your Excellency will see you later!
此人武功高强，你拼尽全力任被其击败。¤This person is highly skilled in martial arts, you fight with all your might any be defeated by it。
无奈还是自身安危要紧，只能先行逃离此地，只是被抢那人恐怕是要性命不保了，不久之后你便走出了这片荒林。¤I have no choice but to flee this place first, only to be robbed that person is afraid of life, soon after you will get out of this deserted forest。
抱歉两位打扰下，不知有啥好东西，在下也想分一杯羹！¤Sorry to disturb the two, I do not know what good things, I also want a piece of the pie!
也不等对方搭话，你便拔出武器冲了上去。¤And do not wait for the other side to talk, you will draw a weapon and rushed up。
对方功夫本就稀松平常，很快便招架不住，被一剑穿心，倒在地上不动了。¤The other side of the Martial Arts is very ordinary, and soon could not fight, was a sword through the heart, fell to the ground and did not move。
阁下好功夫，此子身上藏了不少好东西，咱们一起分了吧。¤Your good Martial Arts, this son has a lot of good things hidden in his body, let's share it together。
此人满脸堆笑一边说着一边朝你靠近，好像还想跟你说点什么。¤This person is full of smiles while talking while approaching you, as if they still want to say something to you。
对方刚一接近，突然表情一寒，手中长剑飞快朝你刺了过来。¤As soon as the other party approached, his expression suddenly became cold, and the long sword in his hand flew towards you。
你虽然对对方有所防备，但是距离太近，虽然避开了致命部位，但是仍然被对方一剑刺中。¤Although you are on guard against the other side, but the distance is too close, although avoid the fatal part, but still by the other side of a sword stabbed。
你对对方本就有所防备，加上自己身法了得，竟然以一个不可思议的姿势躲过了对方这一击。¤You are already on guard against the other side, plus your own body skills are excellent, but in an incredible position to dodge the other side of the strike。
对方见一击必杀未成，接着又朝你攻来。¤The opponent saw that a kill was not achieved, and then attacked you again。
你的功夫更胜一筹，格开对方兵器后一脚踢在其太阳穴上，对方瞬间七孔流血，倒地而亡。¤Your Martial Arts was even better, and you kicked your opponent in the solar plexus after you had blocked his weapon, and he instantly bled to death。
你迅速将地上两具尸体所携带的东西都摸索一空。¤You quickly fished out everything the two bodies were carrying on the ground。
对方功夫本来并不厉害，但是现在性命相搏，出招更是以伤换伤，要大家同归于尽的架势。¤The opponent's Martial Arts was not great, but now the fight for life, the move is more injury for injury, to everyone to die together。
你不愿再继续跟他们纠缠下去，抽了个空档，便退出战团，迅速离开的此地。¤You do not want to continue to tangle with them, took a gap, then exit the battle group, quickly leave the place。
对方先是偷袭，后手攻击接连不断，你被打个措手不及，手忙脚乱之下被对方一脚踹在胸口上。¤The other side first sneak attack, backhand attack after backhand attack, you were caught off guard, under the hands and feet by the other side of a kick in the chest。
你已无力再战，飞退之际，毫不犹豫的改变方向窜入丛林之中，一路狂奔之后终于逃离了这片荒林。¤You are no longer able to fight, flying back when, without hesitation, change direction into the jungle, all the way after running wildly finally escaped from this deserted forest。
江湖上尔虞我诈之事何时少过，哪怕同门也是如此，多管闲事只会自找麻烦，你选择绕道离开了此处。¤You chose to take a detour and left the area。
是在下唐突了，既然如此，咱们青山不改绿水长流，后会有期！¤I'm the one who was abrupt, in that case, the green hills will not change and the water will flow forever, see you later!
师父！徒儿知错了....¤Master! I know I'm wrong ....
这...求师父开恩。¤This... I beg for Master's enlightenment.
徒儿谨记师父教诲！¤I will remember my master's teachings!
弟子不愿受此大辱！就此告辞！¤I don't want to be humiliated by this! This is my farewell!
什么！这怎么可能！¤What! How is this possible!
我看看，这原来不是这样的啊！¤Let's see, this didn't turn out like this!
啊？！这个...这个...¤What? This... This...
我千辛万苦运来的货物，怎会被说得如此不堪...¤The goods that I have taken great pains to bring here, how can they be described as so bad...
你们放开我！求掌门开恩！不！！！¤Let me go! I beg you to be merciful! No!
掌门我不偷懒了！求掌门不要赶我走！¤I won't slack off, Master! Please don't throw me out!
为什么掌门？为什么？¤Why, Master? Why?
这个东西居然传出阵阵恶臭，你闻闻！¤This thing actually emits a gusty stench。 Smell it!
为何这里的手感如此粗糙？¤Why does it feel so rough here?
还有这里，凹凸不平，应该是被摔过！¤And here, it's uneven, it should have been dropped!
这里是被虫蛀过的痕迹！¤Here are traces of insect infestation!
这里有一处潭水,竟然令得附近奇寒无比,真是神奇!¤There is a pool of water here that makes the vicinity strangely cold, it's amazing!
这处寒潭被一层白雾笼罩，而潭水周围都被一层白色冰霜覆盖；此等寒气，恐怕只有强大<color=red>内力</color>之人，方能进入一试。¤This cold pool is covered by a layer of white mist, and the water around it is covered with a layer of white frost; I'm afraid that only someone with strong <color=red>Stance</color> can enter this cold pool and try it out。
你全力运行所学内功，将真气布满全身后，小心翼翼的进入到潭水之中。¤You run your internal energy with all your might, covering your whole body with True Qi, and then carefully enter the pool of water。
你全力运转真气，将寒气隔绝在体外；在寒气不断的刺激下，真气飞速运转，功力在短时间内就获得<color=red>巨大突破！</color>¤You run your True Qi with all your might to isolate the cold qi outside your body; under the constant stimulation of the cold qi, your True Qi soars and your Martial Arts gains <color=red>a huge breakthrough in a short period of time! </color>
你全力运行真气，但是寒气太过猛烈，部分寒气进入了经脉之中横冲直撞；继续下去定会身受重伤，你只能迅速离开了潭水。¤You run your True Qi with all your might, but the cold qi is so fierce that some of it enters your meridians and rampages through your body; if you continue, you will surely be seriously injured, and you can only leave the pool quickly。
在寒潭之中坚持的时间越长，功力提升就越大！¤The longer you hold on in the cold pool, the greater your power will improve!
你的身体有伤在身，进入寒潭之中几乎是九死一生！¤Your body has injuries in the body, into the cold pool is almost nine lives!
你觉得进入寒潭练功风险太大，不值得冒险一试，便转身离开了此处。¤You felt that it was too risky to enter the cold pool to practice Martial Arts and it was not worth the risk, so you turned around and left the place。
你的身体已经受伤，无法继续坚持。¤Your body is already injured and cannot continue to hold on。
你感觉身体已经到了极限，再继续下去会越来越危险；于是你迅速离开了潭水。¤You felt that your body had reached its limit and it would be more and more dangerous to continue; so you quickly left the pool。
你在寒潭中已经浸泡了很长时间，功力增速已经渐渐慢了下来，已经没有必要继续下去。¤You had been immersed in the cold pool for a long time, and the rate of increase of your power had gradually slowed down, so there was no need to continue。
于是你迅速离开了潭水，穿带好衣物便离开了。¤So you quickly left the pool, put on your clothes and left。
你全力运行真气，但是寒气太过猛烈，部分寒气进入了经脉之中横冲直撞；你坚持不住，口吐一口鲜血，加之自身已有严重内伤，如今伤上加伤，已然性命难保！¤You run your True Qi, but the cold is too fierce, part of the cold into the meridian rampage; you can not hold on, spitting a mouthful of blood, coupled with their own serious internal injuries, and now wounded on top of injuries, it is difficult to save your life!
今日我便要血洗<color=red>{0}</color>，为曾经的师兄弟报仇！¤Today, I will take <color=red>{0}</color> and avenge my former brothers and sisters!
什么？！竟是<color=red>飞云门</color>的余孽！快通知帮主！兄弟们上！！¤What? It's the remnants of <color=red>Flying Cloud Sect</color>! Tell the master! Brothers, let's go!
<color=red>{0}</color>掌门已被斩杀！其余帮众也已经被诛杀殆尽，其余之人纷纷仓皇逃窜。¤The <color=red>{0}</color> leader has been killed! The rest of the gang had also been put to death, and the rest of the people fled in a hurry。
不一会，剩余的漏网之鱼也被清扫一空，只剩下横七竖八的尸体，跟到处飞溅的血迹。¤In a short while, the remaining fish in the net had been swept away, leaving only the bodies strewn about and the blood splattered everywhere。
<color=red>{0}</color>宣告覆灭。¤<color=red>{0}</color> was declared to be overwhelmed。
这时候有弟子禀告，在<color=red>{0}</color>掌门的房间中发现一处暗格，打开后发现数本武功秘籍:{1}¤At this time, a disciple reported that a secret compartment was found in <color=red>{0}</color>'s room, and after opening it, several secret martial arts manuals were found:{1}
这是<color=red>飞云门</color>所传承的功法...曾经的师兄弟们，我为你们报仇了！¤This is a technique inherited from the <color=red>Flying Cloud Sect</color>... My former brothers and sisters, I avenge you!
你被<color=red>{0}</color>打败，在众弟子拼死保护之下，勉强逃回了门派中。¤You were defeated by <color=red>{0}</color> and barely escaped back into the sect with all the disciples fighting to the death to protect you。
徒儿今后一定加倍努力！¤I will work harder in the future!
太好啦！师父在上，请受徒儿一拜！¤That's great! Master, please accept my obeisance!
我终于出人头地了！谢谢师父！¤I've finally made it to the top! Thank you, Master!
哼！一点小瑕疵，无伤大雅。¤Hmph! A little flaw, no harm done。
长途跋涉，在所难免！¤Long journey, inevitable!
不能便宜太多！¤Can't be too cheap!

哼！不给钱也行，就让此人拿命来填吧！¤I don't know. If you don't pay, let him pay with his life!
这是一处自然形成的洞穴,不知道里面有什么。¤This is a naturally formed cave,not knowing what is inside。
你深入到洞穴之中，仔细探查了一番，发现不过是一处寻常山洞，并无异常之处。¤You go deeper into the cave and explore it carefully, finding it to be nothing more than an ordinary cave with nothing out of the ordinary。
你深入到洞穴之中，仔细探查了一番，在一处不起眼的位置发现一个破破烂烂的箱子；打开后获得了<color=red>{0}。</color>¤You go deeper into the cave and look around, finding a tattered chest in an inconspicuous spot; you open it and get <color=red>{0}。 </color>。
你深入到洞穴之中，仔细探查了一番，发现洞中居然有一道石门。¤You delve into the cave and explore carefully, finding a stone door actually in the cave。
这道石门没有任何打开的机关，恐怕只能使用<color=red>力量</color>将其推开。¤This stone door has no mechanism to open it, and I'm afraid you can only use <color=red>Strength</color> to push it open。
打开这道石门的机关肯定隐藏在这个山洞中，只是没有强大的<color=red>洞察力</color>恐怕是无法找到。¤The mechanism to open this stone door must be hidden in this cave, but I'm afraid I can't find it without strong <color=red>insight</color>。
石门两侧的洞壁上有许多非自然形成的孔洞，触碰石门的话很可能会触发机关，发出暗器；如果身手不够<color=red>灵敏</color>的话，最好不要尝试。¤There are many unnatural holes in the cave walls on both sides of the door, and touching it will probably trigger the mechanism and send out a concealed weapon; if you are not <color=red>sensitive</color> enough, it is best not to try。
你走到石门前，将双手放在石门之上，气沉丹田，然后大喝一声！用尽全身力量。¤You walk up to the stone door, place your hands on top of it, sink your breath into your dantian, and then bellow! Use all your strength。
石门发出沉闷的移动之声，缓缓的被打开了！¤The stone door makes a dull sound of movement and slowly gets opened!
然而石门纹丝不动！¤However, the stone door did not move at all!
你开始在洞穴之中仔细查找打开石门的机关。¤You began to look carefully in the cave to open the stone door mechanism。
在一个非常不起眼的岩石夹缝中发现一处异样，你伸手一试，居然可以转动，同时听见石门发出沉闷的移动之声，居然缓缓的打开了！¤In a very inconspicuous rock crevice found a strange, you reach out to try, can actually turn, while hearing the dull sound of movement of the stone door, actually slowly opened!
但是搜遍了整个洞穴仍然一无所获。¤But searched the entire cave still found nothing。
你缓缓来到石门前，同时双足隐隐蓄力；果然你刚触碰到石门的一瞬间，破空之声四起，从洞壁上的孔洞射出无数暗器。¤You slowly came to the stone door, at the same time, both feet vaguely accumulate strength; indeed you just touched the stone door a moment, the sound of breaking air, from the holes in the cave wall shot out countless concealed weapons。
你早有准备之下，施展出门派中所学身法，左右腾挪，居然躲开了所有的暗器攻击，然后顺利打开了石门。¤You were prepared for this, and you used the body techniques you learned in the school, moving from side to side, and actually dodged all the concealed weapon attacks, and then successfully opened the stone door。
你虽然早有准备，但是射出的暗器极多，你虽使出全力躲闪，仍然无法前进一步，不敢再往前闯。¤Although you were prepared, but the concealed weapons shot out very much, although you use all your strength to dodge, still can not go further, do not dare to barge forward。
你感觉这个不明洞穴中隐隐散发着危险，而且以目前实力乱闯恐怕会很危险，只能悻悻退了出来。¤You feel that this unknown cave is vaguely emitting danger, and with the current strength of the chaos will be very dangerous, you can only resentfully retreat out。
你进入到石门之中，里面是一处不大不小的石室。¤You enter the stone door, and inside is a small or large stone room。
在石室中央有<color=red>{0}</color>发出微微毫光。¤In the center of the room is <color=red>{0}</color> emitting a faint light。
你开心的将其收入行囊，并退了出来。¤You happily put it in your walking bag and retreat。
你在洞穴中找了一处干净点的地方躺下休息了一段时间，体力恢复了。¤You find a cleaner spot in the cave and lie down to rest for a while, your Vifor returning。
把东西交出来！我让你走！¤Hand over the item! I'll let you go!
那件东西就在你身上！¤That item is on you!
别逼我动手！¤Don't make me do it!
问我手里的刀同不同意！¤Ask the Blade in my hand if it agrees!
光天化日，居然想抢东西？¤You want to take something in broad daylight?
好啊！你来啊！我怕你呀？¤Fine! Go ahead! Am I afraid of you?
朋友！此人身上带了不少好东西,你助我,咱们一人一半,怎么样！¤Friend! This man has a lot of good stuff on him, you help me, we'll each get half!
大侠！这人是个强盗,请帮帮我！¤Warrior! This man is a robber, please help me!
没想到你这么不中用！我先撤了！¤I didn't expect you to be so useless! I'll leave now!
哈哈哈！"合作"愉快。¤Hahaha!" Happy "cooperation".
你打不过他！快跑吧！¤You can't beat him! Run for it!
多谢大侠相救！¤Thanks for saving me, warrior!
你看看这件货，色泽发黄，明显是旧货！¤Look at this。 It's yellow, obviously old!
还有这里怎么块黑斑，难道是坏了？¤And there's a black spot here, is it broken?
天那！这个地方居然都发霉了！¤Oh my God! This place is actually moldy!
这个位置是被老鼠咬过吗？¤Was this spot bitten by a mouse?
乖乖把身上的财物都留下,最好别让我们动手！¤Be a good boy and leave all your belongings behind, and you better not let us do it!
这位朋友,兄弟们最近手头有点紧,能否给个面子,把身上的财物都让给我们？¤My friend, we're a little short of cash these days, so could you do us a favor and give us all your belongings?
站住！打劫！要钱还是要命！¤Stop! Robbery! Money or life!
掌门！弟子并无过错！¤Master! I have done nothing wrong!
求掌门收回成命！¤I beg you to withdraw your order!
弟子的努力，掌门怎可无视！¤How can you ignore my efforts?
我快要饿死了...¤I'm starving to death...
哎...这世道太乱了！¤I'm starving... This world is so messy!
难道要去乞讨吗。¤Do I have to go begging?
哎...在下家乡遭了灾,逃难至此;如今已是无家可归,而且身无分文,饥肠辘辘;大侠能否救救在下。¤Hey... My hometown was hit by a disaster and I fled here; now I have no home to go back to, and I'm starving; can the warrior help me?
谢谢您,好歹能多活两天了;这是我在路上捡到的,就送给你吧。¤Thank you, at least I can live two more days; I found this on the road, so I'll give it to you。
多谢大侠！总算有点希望了;这是我在路上捡到的,就送给你吧。¤Thank you, warrior! Finally, there is some hope; I found this on the road, so I'll give it to you。
真的可以吗？那真是太好了！在下这就前往。¤Is it really okay? That's great! I'll be on my way。
在下代表<color=red>{0}</color>前来,贵派是否有诚意出资<color=red>3000金</color>，来改善一下双方的关系？¤I come on behalf of <color=red>{0}</color>, do you have the sincerity to contribute <color=red>3000 gold</color> to improve our relationship?
果然识趣！告辞了。（与<color=red>{0}</color>关系提升了！目前关系为<color=red>{1}</color>）¤Surely you have the sense to do so! Farewell。 (Relationship with <color=red>{0}</color> has been upgraded! Current relationship is <color=red>{1}</color>)
好！不愿意给的话，我们会自己来取！到时候可别后悔！（与<color=red>{0}</color>关系下降了！目前关系为<color=red>{1}</color>）¤Good! If you don't want to give it to us, we'll come and get it ourselves! Don't regret it when the time comes! (Relationship with <color=red>{0}</color> has gone down! Current relationship is <color=red>{1}</color>)
监牢里的俘虏<color=red>{0}</color>乘我们守卫松懈之时逃走了，我们应该<color=red>加强守卫</color>，修建更<color=red>牢固的牢房</color>才行。¤The captives in the prison <color=red>{0}</color> escaped when our guards were lax, we should <color=red>strengthen our guards</color> and build stronger cells</color> to do so。
在下{0}<color=red>{1}</color>，行走江湖四处磨炼自己的武技，恰巧路过此地，不知能否与贵派高手切磋一二。¤I {0}<color=red>{1}</color>, walking around the jianghu to sharpen my martial arts skills, happened to pass by here, and I wonder if I can have a sparring session with your school's masters。
哈哈哈哈~连接受挑战的勇气都没有，还算什么江湖门派，告辞了！¤I don't even have the courage to accept the challenge, so what kind of Jianghu school is that?
贵派果然有高手！在下输的心服口服，待改日再来拜会。¤Your school really does have masters! I am convinced that I have lost, so I will come back another day to pay my respects。
不错不错！今日玩得很尽兴，在下告辞。¤Not bad, not bad! I've had a good time today, so I'll leave now。
师父，我有一位习武资质不错的朋友特别想加入本门，希望师父可以同意。¤Master, I have a friend with good martial arts skills who would like to join our school, I hope you will agree。
太好了！谢谢师父！(<color=red>心情提升了</color>)¤Great! Thank you, Master! (<color=red>Mood lifted</color>)
不行吗？哎...好吧，我回去劝劝他。(<color=red>心情下降了</color>)¤You can't? No? Okay, I'll go back and persuade him. (<color=red>Mood has dropped</color>)

大侠！我昨日听你所说山下的江湖世界,心生向往~在下也想<color=red>加入</color>大侠所在的门派！不知道可不可以......¤The warrior! I heard you talking about the world below the mountain yesterday and I'm looking forward to it~ I would also like to <color=red>join</color> your school! I don't know if it's possible ......
太好了~我收拾收拾，马上就赶过去！¤I'll pack up and go there right away!
哈哈哈哈~我也能加入门派了！¤Hahahahahaha~ I can join the sect too!
我也要做一个大侠！¤I want to be a warrior too!
江湖~我来了！¤I'm coming!
哎~可能我不是练武的料，还是老老实实种地吧。¤I'm not a martial arts practitioner, so I'll just be honest and farm。
夜半时分，你听到屋外突然传来喊杀声！¤In the middle of the night, you hear the sudden sound of shouting and killing from outside your house!
哈哈哈哈哈~~没想到这么一个山沟沟里还有个村子，老规矩！男的杀光，女的带回山寨！¤ Kill all the men, the women back to the cottage!
听外面的声音，应该是来了一伙山贼。¤Listen to the sound outside, should be a group of mountain bandits。
对方人数众多，你恐不敌；于是乘夜色逃出了村子。¤The number of opponents is large, you are afraid of defeat; so take the night to escape from the village。
村子里都是普通百姓，恐怕无力抵抗，你决定帮忙赶走这帮山贼，于是直接冲了出去！¤The village is full of ordinary people, so you decided to help chase away the bandits, so you went straight out!
干什么？你敢反抗？给我杀！¤What are you doing? You dare to resist? Kill them!
你被山贼打败,听着身后山民传来的惨叫,勉强逃离了山村。¤You were defeated by the bandits and barely escaped from the village as you listened to the screams of the mountain people behind you。
山贼被你击败,一窝蜂的逃入了山林之中不见踪影。¤The bandits were defeated by you and fled into the mountains in a swarm。
有个跑得慢的，被你一把抓住，摁在地上。¤One of the slow runners was caught by you and pinned to the ground。
饶命啊大侠！小的上有老下有小，落草为寇也是生活所迫啊！¤Spare my life, warrior! I have an old man and a young man, so I have to live like a bandit!
这些山贼，平时作恶多端，只能杀一儆百；你根本不听求饶，直接一掌拍在其心口，对方一声惨叫后立马就没了声息。¤These mountain bandits, usually do a lot of evil, can only kill one example; you simply do not listen to beg for mercy, a direct slap on its heart, the other side of a scream immediately after the sound is gone。
这些山贼，平时作恶多端，断然不能放其离开；于是你将此人困了个严实，打算带回门派再做定夺。¤These mountain thieves, usually do a lot of evil, categorically can not let them go; so you trapped this person a tight, intended to bring back to the sect before making a decision。
多谢大侠救命之恩！只是这些逃走的山贼恐怕还会再来，我们全村只能搬走了。¤Thank you for saving my life! But I'm afraid that these escaped bandits will come again, so our village will have to move away。
村子很穷，无以为报大侠的大恩大德，这里是全村人凑集的一点钱，大侠一定要收下。¤The village is very poor, and there is no way to repay the warrior's kindness。 Here is a little money gathered by the whole village。
你获得<color=red>金钱{0}</color>¤You gain <color=red>Money{0}</color>
谁来救救我.....¤Somebody help me .....
可恶...居然敢伤我！¤Damn... How dare you hurt me!
难道要死在这吗...¤Do you want to die here...
在下被仇人所伤...现在伤势严重...再不治疗,恐怕要死在这了,咳...咳...咳...;这位大侠,是否有<color=red>伤药</color>救救在下！¤I was injured by an enemy... I'm in serious condition... If I don't get treatment, I'm afraid I'll die here. Cough... Cough... cough... Cough... cough... cough... This warrior, do you have any <color=red>injury medicine</color> to help me!
此人服下丹药后,气息逐渐平稳了下来。¤After this person took the elixir, his breath gradually stabilized。
不知是伤势过重还是丹药的药力不足,此人服下丹药后,并没有起到作用,渐渐没了呼吸。¤I don't know if the injury is too serious or the potency of the pill is not enough, this person took the pill and it didn't work, and gradually lost his breath。
多谢大侠救命之恩！等在下伤势痊愈,定当登门拜谢！¤Thank you for saving my life! When I heal, I will come to the door to thank you!
天要亡我！¤God will kill me!
各位英雄好汉！又到了一年一度的“大衍武道大会”。¤Dear heroes and heroines! It's time for the annual 'Dayan Martial Arts Conference'.
大家是否已经准备大展拳脚，争夺那魁首之位呢！¤Are you all ready to show off your skills and compete for the top spot?

这个位置有一道明显的裂纹，你没看到？¤There's a clear crack in this spot, don't you see?
而且这里的纹路凌乱，有点像是假货！¤And the lines here are messy, kind of like a fake!
此物浑浊不堪，简直就是以次充好！¤This thing is so cloudy, it's just second best!
这个东西的质地明显不对！¤The texture of this thing is obviously not right!

本城就咱这一家客栈最好~¤This is the best inn in town。
没钱可住不了！¤You can't stay here without money!
好勒~大侠您好好休息~¤Okay, rest well, warrior。
大侠昨晚休息得可好。¤You had a good rest last night。
哈哈哈~朋友莫不是在说笑！¤Hahahaha~ You're not joking!
此物本就是如此，莫要在鸡蛋里挑骨头！¤This is what it is, so don't pick holes in it!
这可是好东西，你不要我可卖给别人了？¤This is a good thing, you don't want it, I can sell it to someone else?
谢掌门赏识！¤Thank you, Master!
今后定为本门肝脑涂地！¤I'm going to be the best of my life!
弟子的努力终于被掌门看到了！¤My efforts have finally been seen by the master!
敢关我！你们死定了！¤How dare you lock me up! You are dead!
我劝你们最好放了我！¤I advise you to let me go!
我朋友会来救我的！¤My friends will come to save me!
我厌倦了江湖。¤I'm tired of the jianghu.
不想再打打杀杀了。¤Don't want to fight and kill anymore.
希望不会有人来抓我。¤I hope no one will come to arrest me.
闯荡江湖不能没有好兵刃,快进来瞧瞧！¤You can't go into the world without a good blade, come in and see!
您一共<color=#E73434>花费是{0}</color>,<color=#21B330>收入{1}</color>,要不要再买点，有备无患！¤Your total <color=#E73434>cost is {0}</color>, <color=#21B330>income is {1}</color>, do you want to buy some more?
大侠真是好眼力,好东西全都是您的了！¤You've got a good eye, you've got all the good stuff!
没钱别来消遣我！¤Don't amuse me if you don't have money!
有不少好兵刃,您再多挑挑~¤There are a lot of good blades, you can pick more。
马上又有一批神兵利器要出炉了！记得再来看看。¤There will be another batch of weapons coming out soon! Remember to come back and take a look。
大侠,您的装备完好,不需要修理。¤Warrior, your equipment is in good condition and does not need repair。
您的这件装备已经破烂不堪,不能修了,要不您重新买一件吧！¤Your equipment is in bad shape and can't be repaired, so why don't you buy a new one?
没问题！<color=#E73434>费用是{0}</color>,保证让您的兵器完好如初！¤No problem! <color=#E73434>The cost is {0}</color>, and your weapon is good as new!
修好了！快看看,是不是比以前更好了！¤It's fixed! Look at it, it's better than ever!
装备可要经常保养才行。¤You need to take care of your equipment regularly。
材料品质都不错，合作愉快。¤The materials are of good quality, happy cooperation.
你正行至半路,忽然从路旁窜出<color=red>{0}</color>名手持刀剑之人,观其打扮,应该不是什么好人！¤You are halfway to the road when suddenly <color=red>{0}</color> a man with a sword appears from the side of the road, and by the way he is dressed, he should not be a good man!
这是一座山寨,还能隐约听到从寨中传出的大笑与女人嚎哭的声音。¤This is a mountain fortress, from which we can still faintly hear the sound of laughter and women crying。
这些山贼必定是作恶多端之辈，如果不除掉，周边的百姓必定永无宁日；你毫不犹豫的冲了进去。¤The company's main business is to provide a wide range of products and services to the public。
嗯？！什么人！居然有人敢单枪匹马闯我们山寨！不要命了？¤What? What a man! How dare someone break into our fortress alone! Don't you want to die?
这里是山贼都老巢，穷凶极恶之徒众多，再下去恐怕会很危险，你只能选择撤退。¤This is the lair of the bandits, there are many vicious people, if you continue, it will be very dangerous, you can only choose to retreat。
你消灭了一些山贼，然而又不少人冲过来。¤You eliminated some bandits, but many more rushed over。
你又消灭了一波山贼，但是后面还有人继续冲了上来。¤You eliminate another wave of bandits, but there are still people coming up behind you。
没想到此处山贼居然如此凶恶，你竟然不敌，只能匆匆逃离此处。¤You didn't expect the bandits here to be so vicious that you were outmatched and had to flee in a hurry。
你已经杀红了眼，满身都溅满了山贼的鲜血；周围的山贼此时已经吓破了胆，纷纷丢下武器逃出了山寨。¤You have killed the red eyes, covered with the blood of the bandits; surrounding bandits have been scared out of their wits, have dropped their weapons and fled the fortress。
此时你来到山寨各处，释放了那些被抓到山寨中的妇女；而且这伙山贼抢夺来的财物也都被你一并拿走。¤At this time you came to the fortress everywhere, released the women who were caught in the fortress; and the bandits robbed the belongings were also taken by you。
此人名叫<color=red>{0}</color>,不仅骨骼惊奇,而且毅力非凡,一定是练武的好材料,只要<color=red>{1}</color>,绝对划算！¤This man's name is <color=red>{0}</color>, not only his bones are amazing, but also his perseverance is extraordinary, he must be a good material for martial arts training, just <color=red>{1}</color>, definitely a good deal!
此人可不得了~虽然不懂武艺,但是却力大无穷,名叫<color=red>{0}</color>,稍加磨炼,必然是贵派顶梁之柱！<color=red>{1}</color>！不二价!¤He's not a martial artist, but he's very strong, and his name is <color=red>{0}</color>, with a little training, he'll be a pillar of your school! <color=red>{1}</color>! I'm not a bad price!
不愧是高门大派,此人名叫<color=red>{0}</color>,就是要这样的人才能配得上,<color=red>{1}</color>这种价格,您绝对是捡到便宜了。¤<color=red>{0}</color>, this is the kind of person you need to be worthy of, <color=red>{1}</color> at this price, you definitely got a bargain。
嘿嘿嘿~那再看看别的,不着急~¤Hey, hey, hey, look at the other ones, no rush。
嘿嘿嘿~有钱能使鬼推磨,一分钱钞一分货！这个世道,人才最贵！等您钱凑够了再来。¤The most important thing is to have a good idea of what to expect。 In this world, talent is the most expensive! When you have enough money to come back。
哈哈哈~果然好眼光！恭喜贵派离一统江湖又进了一步！¤Hahahaha, you have a good eye! Congratulations, your school is one step closer to unifying the kung-fu world!
这人一副病病殃殃的样子,<color=red>{0}</color>吧,不能再多了!¤This man looks sickly, <color=red>{0}</color> right, no more!
啧啧啧~这人是不是被毒打过啊？看样子还有内伤,我怕买回去几天就死掉啊！就值<color=red>{0}</color>,我担风险的！¤Tsk, tsk, tsk~ Has this person been severely beaten? It also looks like there are internal injuries, I'm afraid I'll die within a few days of buying it back! It's worth <color=red>{0}</color>, I take the risk!
哎哟~此人怕不是个残疾哦~可惜可惜！看在贵派的面子上,<color=red>{0}</color>!我帮贵派处理掉~¤I'm afraid this person is not a handicap, but a pity。 For the sake of your faction, <color=red>{0}</color>! I'll help your faction get rid of it。
哎哟~还是个女子！长相还不错~嘿嘿嘿~我愿意出<color=red>{0}</color>!怎么样~这可是天价！¤Ouch~ It's still a woman! I'm willing to pay <color=red>{0}</color>! How's that~ It's a heavenly price!
我的天！此人是四大门派的弟子！我可不敢收！¤Oh my god! This person is a disciple of one of the four great sects! I wouldn't dare take it!
此人我就收下了~合作愉快~¤I'll take this person。
嘿嘿嘿~等我收点<color=red>"好货"</color>再过来~¤Hey hey hey~ I'll come back when I get some <color=red>"goodies"</color>.
这里竟然是一处温泉,进去泡一下应该很舒服!¤This is a hot spring, it should be very comfortable to soak in it!
你与随行弟子缓缓进入泉水中；温暖的泉水按摩着全身，无比舒服。¤You and the accompanying disciples slowly into the spring; warm spring water massage the whole body, incomparable comfort。
泡完温泉之后，大家体力与气血都已全部恢复；而且感觉自己的身体变得更强了，实在是无比神奇！所有角色<color=red>({0}提升{1})</color>¤After soaking in the hot spring, everyone's Lifeforce and qi have all been restored; and it feels like your body has become stronger, it's beyond amazing! All characters <color=red>({0} raise {1})</color>
泡完温泉之后，大家体力与气血都已恢复，随行弟子的伤势也得以<color=red>治疗</color>，实在是无比神奇！¤After soaking in the hot spring, everyone had recovered their Lifeforce and qi, and the injuries of the accompanying disciples had been <color=red>healed</color>, which was beyond amazing!
前方不远的地方好像有一个洞穴。¤There seems to be a cave not far ahead。
前方有炊烟袅袅升起,好像有人家在附近居住。¤There is smoke rising up ahead, as if there are people living nearby。
前方有丝丝寒气袭来。¤There is a hint of cold air coming from ahead。
前方隐隐有热气拂面而来。¤There is a faint heat coming from the front。
前方山林中好像有一处不小的营寨。¤There seems to be a small camp in the forest ahead。
什么？我不是奸细！！别抓我！¤What? I'm not a spy! Don't arrest me!
啊？！救命啊！！¤Don't arrest me! Help!
我不！！这里是土匪窝吗！¤I'm not!!! Is this a bandit den!
呸！想都别想！¤Yuck! Don't even think about it!
哼！尔等小帮小派也想招揽我！？¤Hmph! You little gangsters want to recruit me!
我与你们势不两立！滚！¤I'm against you! Get out!
请选择投资金额。{0}¤Please select the amount to invest。 {0}
你使用{0}的资金在城中进行了投资。¤You used {0} to make an investment in the city。

以上就是本次拍卖会的所有拍品。¤These are all the lots in this auction.
不知各位大侠是否已经将心仪之物收入囊中呢。¤I don't know if you have already pocketed your favorite items.
下届拍卖会定为诸位收集更加珍贵的宝物，欢迎再次参加！¤The next auction will be set for you to collect more precious treasures, welcome to participate again!
本次“大衍拍卖会”到此结束。¤This is the end of the auction.
呵呵呵！如此松懈的守卫，也想困住本大侠，先走一步了！¤Heh heh heh! Such lax guards, also want to trap this warrior, go first!
呼呼....好险！终于溜出来了。¤Hoo-hoo .... That was close! Finally slipped out.
这种监牢，本人想走随时可以走，哼！¤This prison, I can leave whenever I want, huh!
原来是{0}的朋友！咱们两派交好，自然是没有问题。¤So they are friends of {0}! The two schools are good friends, so naturally there is no problem。
本门与贵派<color=red>交际甚少</color>,恐怕不能接受阁下这样的要求。¤Our school has <color=red>very little intercourse with your school</color>, I'm afraid I cannot accept such a request from you。
经过一段时间的学习,你的感悟颇深,当前功法经验获得<color=red>大幅提升！</color>¤After a period of study, you have gained <color=red>a great deal of insight, and your current meritocratic experience has been <color=red>substantially enhanced! </color>
距离上次学习的<color=red>时间太短</color>,暂时无法获得新的感悟！¤The <color=red>time since you last studied is too short</color> to gain new insights for now!
这些破铜烂铁,贵派还是留着自己用吧！¤Your school should keep these broken pieces of iron for your own use!
哈哈哈哈！快快请进,贵派真是客气,来就来还带这么多东西。¤Hahahahaha! Come on in, your school is so polite to come and bring so much stuff。
那再好不过！互通有无对咱们都有好处,自然是没有问题！¤That's great! It's in our best interest to trade with each other, so it's no problem。
贸易往来是你我门中大事,不可草率！¤Trade is an important matter for our sect, we must not be hasty!
贵派做了一个错误的决定, 实在太遗憾了！¤It's a pity that your sect made a wrong decision。
那简直太好了！咱们两派联合起来，迟早能一统江湖，哈哈哈哈~¤That's great! If we join forces, we will sooner or later be able to unify the world, hahahaha。
双方结盟可是大事，还需要从长计议才行！¤An alliance is a big deal。 We need to think long and hard about it。
什么！要准备与我们为敌了吗！？¤What? Are you ready to make an enemy of us?
以咱们两派的关系,有困难一定得帮助！这些东西你带回去,或许能帮助贵派度过难关。¤With the relationship between our two factions, we must help if we have difficulties! These things you bring back, may be able to help your school through difficulties。
什么？哪儿来的要饭的？滚出去！¤What? Where's the beggar? Get out of here!
遵命！每年一定为宗门供奉足额资源。¤Yes, sir! I will provide the sect with the full amount of resources every year。
遵命！每年一定为宗门供奉足额物资。¤Yes, sir! We will provide the clan with a full amount of supplies every year。
遵命！这是本门秘籍<color=red>{0}</color>，望助宗门早日一统江湖。¤Yes, sir! This is the secret book of the clan <color=red>{0}</color>, I hope to help the clan unify the rivers and lakes as soon as possible。
遵命！定为宗门源源不断发觉各类优秀弟子。¤Yes, sir! We will continue to find excellent disciples of all kinds for the clan。
这...这是本门传承之功法，实在不敢交出，求宗门收回成命。¤This... This is the inheritance of the gongfu, really do not dare to hand over, beg the sect to withdraw into the order.
求宗门高抬贵手...求宗门高抬贵手...容许我等再考虑考虑。¤I'd like to ask you to give me a hand... Please... Allow us to reconsider.
什么！！你们也会有这一天！！你们这群贼子！！啊！！！！¤What! This day will come for you too! You bunch of thieves! Ah ！！！！
<color=red>{0}</color>已被屠戮一空。¤<color=red>{0}</color> has been slaughtered。
获得门派秘籍<color=red>{0}</color>。¤Get the secret book of the sect <color=red>{0}</color>。
你们欺人太甚，哪怕与你们玉石俱焚也不再对你们臣服！¤You are so deceitful that I would not submit to you even if I were to burn with you!
刚刚听到消息，最近本门将要宣布与<color=red>雷火帮</color>结盟。¤I just heard the news that our clan is going to announce an alliance with the <color=red>Thunderfire Gang</color> recently。
可是我<color=red>飞云门</color>与对方已经争斗数十年，怎会突然就化解仇恨结为同盟！¤However, we have been fighting with each other for decades, so how could we suddenly resolve our hatred and form an alliance?
此事必有蹊跷，我必须找掌门询问一番。¤There must be something fishy about this, so I must ask the Sect Leader about it。
掌门！我们与<color=red>雷火帮</color>乃是世仇，对方突然提出结盟，肯定背后有阴谋，不能草率决定！¤Sect Leader! We have a long-standing feud with the <color=red>Thunderfire Gang</color>, and if they suddenly propose an alliance, there must be a conspiracy behind it, so we can't make a hasty decision。
我派近些年来已经式微，再与<color=red>雷火帮</color>斗下去，门派迟早要覆灭，现在对方既然主动要求同盟，我们正好有所喘息，也可尝试化解多年双方仇恨。¤Our sect has been in decline in recent years, and if we continue to fight with the <color=red>Thunderfire Gang</color>, our sect will be wiped out sooner or later。
掌门！我入<color=red>飞云门</color>十余年，跟随本门弟兄与<color=red>雷火帮</color>打过无数交道，对方帮主极其狡诈。¤The other side is asking for an alliance, so we can take a breather and try to resolve the hatred between the two sides。 I have been a member of the <color=red>Flying Cloud Sect</color> for more than 10 years, and I have followed our brothers to deal with the <color=red>Thunderfire Gang</color> for countless times, and the other gang leader is extremely cunning。
近年我等虽然式微，但是门中弟子却越来越是骁勇，对方损失也很大，现在不敢和我们硬拼，便想使用阴谋诡计来对付我们，掌门千万不能相信他们。¤In recent years, although we are in decline, our disciples are becoming more and more brave, and the other side has lost a lot of money, so now they don't dare to fight us hard, so they want to use tricks to deal with us。
我们虽与<color=red>雷火帮</color>结为同盟，但也会有所提防，此乃门中大事！你莫要再说，马上给我退下！¤Although we are allied with the <color=red>Thunderfire Gang</color>, we will be on guard, this is an important matter for the sect! Don't say another word, back off now!
可是<color=red>雷火帮</color>是狼子野心！他们这么多年一直想要吞并我们，所谓“同盟”不过是借口！肯定会在背后暗算我们的！¤But the <color=red>Thunderfire Gang</color> is ambitious! They've been trying to annex us for years, and the so-called 'alliance' is just an excuse! They'll definitely try to get us behind our backs!
一派胡言！我派即将与<color=red>雷火帮</color>结为盟友，怎能容你坏了我门中大事！从现在开始我便将你逐出师门！收拾好你的东西，现在就给我离开！¤This is nonsense! Our sect is about to become allies with the <color=red>Thunderfire Gang</color>, how can we allow you to ruin our sect? From now on, I will expel you from the sect! Pack up your things and leave now!
什么！我为本门出生入死十余年，为门派赴汤蹈火，数次险些丢掉性命，对门派忠心耿耿，只为帮助门派发展壮大，现在竟然如此随意就要将我逐出师门？¤What! I've been working for our sect for more than ten years, I've risked my life for the sect, I've been loyal to the sect, I've only helped the sect to grow and develop, and now you want to expel me from the sect so casually?
既然如此，就此拜别，望掌门保重！¤If that's the case, I'll say goodbye and hope that you take care of yourself!
掌门怎能如此对我！还轻信对方之言，几乎就等于任人鱼肉，而我又做不了什么，只能先自己立足以后再做打算。¤How can you treat me like this? I can't do anything about it, but I can only make my own plans later。
这个地方还算不错，先在这里安家吧。¤This place is not bad, let's settle here first。
这里地势不错，可以在此先行安顿下来，可是白手起家何其困难！¤The terrain here is good, you can settle down here first, but how difficult it is to start with nothing!
先不想那么多，必须先有收入才行，我除了一身武艺别无长处，只能先在此地教人习武再慢慢发展。¤Let's not overthink it.. First, I must secure income. I have nothing but my martial art. I should focus on teaching  and then slowly develop。
呼呼……终于建好了，教人习武也得有个地方才行，看样子还不错！进去看看吧。¤Hoo hoo 。。。。。。 It's finally built. To teach people to practice martial arts I also need to have a place of my own. Looks pretty good! Let's go inside and take a look。
先要给武馆定一个合适的学费；学费多少会影响到招收学徒的概率，现在我们还没什么名声，每月<color=red>30金</color>就差不多了。¤First, we need to set an appropriate tuition fee for the martial arts school; the amount of tuition will affect the probability of recruiting apprentices, and now that we don't have much of a reputation, <color=red>30 gold</color> per month is about right。
嗯，就这么多吧，反正学费随时都可以调整，现在就等学徒上门了。¤Well, that's it, the fee can be adjusted at any time anyway, now we're just waiting for apprentices to come to us。
请问… 这里是武馆吗？可以学功夫那种吗？¤Excuse me。。。 is this a Sect ? The kind where you can learn Martial Arts?
没错！本人十八般兵器样样精通，来就对了！哈哈哈~¤Yes! I am proficient in all 18 kinds of weapons, so you've come to the right place! Ha ha ha!
好呀好呀！我要学！¤Oh, yes, yes! I want to learn!
总算是有收入了，我们先开始<color=red>下个月</color>，再走一步算一步吧。¤Finally, we have an income, so let's start <color=red>next month</color> and, from there, take one step at a time。
通过这段时间观察,没想到发现其中一名学徒资质不错。¤Through this period of observation, I did not expect to find apprentices with good qualifications。
以后要发展壮大必须要有一帮优秀的徒弟才行，试下能否将其收为入门弟子培养一番，他现在人应该在<color=red>主厅</color>练功呢。¤We need a group of good disciples to develop and grow in the future, so let's try to see if we can take him as a junior disciple and train him。
经过这一个月的观察，发现你的习武资质不错，想收你为我入门弟子，你可愿意？¤After a month of observation, I found that you have good martial arts qualifications and would like to take you as my junior disciple, are you willing?
真的吗？太好了！特别希望能学到绝世武功，成为一代大侠！¤Really? That's great! I especially hope to learn the best martial arts and become a great warrior!
哈哈哈~好，现在开始你就是我的入门弟子了，自然会好好栽培于你。¤Hahahaha~ Good, now you are my disciple, naturally I will train you well。
多谢师父，请受徒儿一拜。¤Thank you, Master。 Please accept my obedience。
哈哈哈~好吧 你先回去练功，我会单独找时间传授你武艺。¤Ha ha ha ~ well you go back to practice first, I will find time to teach you martial arts personally。
是！师父!¤Yes! Master!
我现在收了一名弟子，但是才刚刚习武，我的功法他还无法练习，要专门为他准备一套武技才行。¤I've taken in a disciple now, but he's just learning martial arts, he can't practice my techniques yet, so I have to prepare a set of martial arts techniques specifically for him to do so。
我自幼习武，自诩也是悟性非凡，自创一套入门武技还是能做到的。¤I have been practicing martial arts since I was young, and I boast that I also have extraordinary Wits, so I can still create my own set of introductory martial arts skills。
以后就在<color=red>武楼</color>摸索新的武学吧。¤From now on, I will just feel for new martial arts at the <color=red>Martial Hall</color>。
要自创功法的话，还需要驻守弟子进行护法才能起到事半功倍的作用，正好让我那刚收的弟子驻守在<color=red>武楼</color>里吧。¤If you want to create your own martial arts, you need to have a statined disciple to maintain order to get twice the result with half the effort, so let my newly accepted disciple be stationed at the <color=red>Martial Hall</color>。
好了现在有弟子驻守 我们可以进入开始自创一套功法吧。¤Well, now that we have a disciple in residence, we can go in and start creating our own Skillsets。
选择需要的<color=red>招式类型</color>与<color=red>属性</color>，调整<color=red>威力</color>，会显示消耗相应的<color=red>参悟值</color>，然后选择<color=red>护法弟子</color>就可以参悟功法了。¤Select the desired <color=red>stance type</color> and <color=red>attribute</color>, adjust the <color=red>power</color>, it will show the corresponding <color=red>enlightenment value</color> consumed, then select <color=red>Guardian Disciple</ color>and then select <color=red>Guardian Disciple</color> to enlighten the technique.
嗯，这部功法很适合给我这名弟子学习。¤Well, this gong method is very suitable for this disciple of mine to learn。
但是只有功法却没有武器是不行的，还好之前从门派出来的时候带了一些，现在和功法一起都放在仓库里。¤But it is not possible to have only Skillsets without weapons。 Fortunately, I brought some with me when I left my original sect. They are in the warehouse together with the Skillsets。
在<color=red>主厅</color>中的<color=red>弟子管理</color>找到<color=red>入门弟子</color>并且把功法和装备都给弟子装备上。¤In <color=red>Disciple Management</color> in the <color=red>Main Hall</color>, find <color=red>Introductory Disciple</color> and equip him with both the techniques and equipment。
点击<color=red>背包任意空格</color>打开仓库，然后<color=red>点击右键</color>进行装备与学习功法。¤Click <color=red>any space in your backpack</color> to open the warehouse, and then <color=red>right click</color> to equip and learn the technique.
好了，现在弟子功法和装备都有了，使用中的功法会随着时间慢慢成长，能学到什么程度就靠他自己了。我们先进入<color=red>下个月</color>吧。¤Well, now that the disciple has all his Skillsets and equipment, the Skillsets in use will grow slowly over time, and it's up to him how much he can learn。 Let's go into <color=red>next month</color> first。
这里管事的是谁！给我出来！¤Who's in charge here! Come out here!
正是在下，足下是哪位。¤It is I, who is the foot soldier。
谁让你在这里教人武功的？这里是我<color=red>雷火帮</color>的地盘，有没有跟我们打过招呼？¤Who told you to teach martial arts here? This is my <color=red>Thunderfire Gang's</color> territory, did you say hello to us?
（这里居然也被<color=red>雷火帮</color>控制了吗？）¤(Is this place actually controlled by the <color=red>Thunderfire Gang</color> as well?)
原来这样，在下初来乍到，还真不知道有这事，不知道需要什么条件呢。¤I'm new here, I really didn't know this was happening, I don't know what conditions are required。
好说好说，缴上10000保护费，让你在这随便做啥生意都行！¤I don't know what the conditions are。 I'll pay the 10,000 protection fee and let you do whatever you want here!
这…！¤This。。。!
师父！别理他，这人是附近的无赖，专门欺骗外来人的，他根本不是<color=red>雷火帮</color>的弟子。¤Master! Don't pay attention to him, this guy is a scoundrel from the neighborhood, specializing in cheating outsiders, he is not a disciple of <color=red>Thunderfire Gang</color> at all。
哪来的小崽子，看爷爷不收拾你！¤Where's the little brat from? Let's see if grandpa won't fix you!
小心！¤Watch out!
对方被打败后，一边放着狠话一边逃跑离开了。¤After the other party was defeated, he fled and left while letting out vicious words。
你胆子到是不小，没练几天功夫就敢跟人动手。¤You have a lot of guts, you didn't practice Martial Arts for a few days and you dare to fight with someone。
师父，这种小混混，正好交给徒儿练手了，师父教的功夫果然厉害！¤Master, this is just rabble. Let me practice ! You told me such powerful Arts ! 
切记与人动手要先观察对手虚实，不可以貌取人，不然小心吃大亏。¤Remember to fight with people to observe the opponent's true strength. Do not judge people by their appearance, or your risk a huge surprise and a staggering loss。
徒儿记住了。¤I will remember。
好，都下去各自练功去吧。¤All right, go and practice your own Martial Arts。
是！师父！¤Yes! Master!
现在过来的学徒已经比较多了，像今日这种情况恐怕以后还会遇到，不能随随便便就让外人进入才行。¤Now there are more apprentices coming over, and I'm afraid we'll encounter more like this in the future, so we can't just let every outsider in。
有了山门就可以阻挡外人随意进出了，但是同样的需要有弟子驻守其中才能发挥作用。¤With a mountain Gate, outsiders can be prevented from entering and leaving at will, but again, a disciple needs to be stationed there for it to be effective。
现在也没其他事情了 开始<color=red>下个月</color>吧。¤Now there's nothing else to do, let's start <color=red>next month</color>。
师父，今日弟子外出采购的时候听说最近江湖上发现了一件大事！¤Master, today when I was out shopping I heard that a great thing has been discovered in the Rivers and Lakes recently!
呵呵！江湖是非多，时不时就有不大不小的事情到处流传，最近有出了什么大事了？¤Oh! There are a lot of rights and wrongs outside, and from time to time, there are big and small events going on。
听说一个叫<color=red>飞云门</color>的门派，一夜之间被<color=red>雷火帮</color>全部屠杀一空，一个都没留下呢，<color=red>飞云门</color>掌门尸体现在都还被吊在山门示众呢。¤I heard that a Sect called <color=red>Flying Cloud Sect</color> was slaughtered overnight by the <color=red>Thunder Fire Gang</color>, leaving no one behind, and the corpse of the <color=red>Flying Cloud Sect</color> leader is still hanging in the mountain gate for public display。
什么！！！¤What!!!
啊？师父怎…怎么了…？¤What? Master how。。。 what happened。。。?
没事… 你先下去吧，为师有点事要处理。¤Nothing。。。 you can.. proceed. I have some business to take care of。
哦… 那徒儿先告辞了。¤Oh。。。 then I'll take my leave。
没想到才短短数月！就发生了这种事！¤I didn't expect that in just a few months! So after all... It happened!
我虽已脱离<color=red>飞云门</color>，但是里面有我出生入死的师兄弟，掌门…也对我有授业之恩，我要马上回去看看。¤I've already left the <color=red>Flying Cloud Sect</color>, but there are brothers and sisters in it who were not supposed to die, and the master。。。 also had the grace to teach me. I... I have to go back there immediately。
你赶到的时候天色已经傍晚，原本应有弟子驻守的山门处只剩血迹斑斑，而有一人被吊在山门最高处的房檐上，从穿着上看确实是掌门无疑。¤When you arrived, it was already evening, and there was only blood at the gate where the disciples should have been stationed, and there was a man hanging from the highest eave of the gate, and from the way he was dressed, he was indeed the Sect Leader。
你施展轻功登上山门，将掌门放了下来，看着尸体触目惊心的伤势，心情无比悲痛。¤You perform your movement skills to ascend the mountain gate, put the master down. You took time to look at the body's grievous injuries, in deep grief。
掌门…你当初为何不愿听我之言…¤Master 。。。 why you did not want to listen to my words 。。。
现在事情已经发生，无法挽回；你在山门附近将掌门下葬后，便赶回了家。¤What happened cannot be undone; you rushed home after burying the Sect Leader near the mountain gate。
<color=red>雷火帮</color>一群贼子，总有一天，我会找你们算账！¤That <color=red>Thunderfire Gang</color>... A group of thieves. One day, I will settle accounts with you!
但是现在我势单力薄，要想报仇要等到何年何月，我必须也要有自己的一方势力才行！¤But now I'm alone, I have to wait until the right moment to take revenge, I must also have a strong Sect by my side to do so!
徒儿，为师打算在此开宗立派，建立一番基业，你可愿从此跟随为师，也成为江湖里的一方势力！¤I intend to establish a sect here, to build a foundation, you want to follow me from now on, we'll become an unstoppable force in this world !
那徒儿岂不是开山大弟子了？太好了！¤Wouldn't that make you a great disciple? Great!
师父，我们门派叫什么名字啊？¤Master, what is the name of our sect?
我们的门派就叫¤Our Sect will be called...
好气派的名字！¤What an elegant name!
作为一个门派 现在这里的建设还不够。¤As a sect Now the facilities here are not sufficient。
好了，这才是一个门派应该有的样子！¤Well, that's what a sect should be like!
(等我实力壮大！第一个便要踏平你<color=red>雷火帮</color>！)¤(When I get stronger! I'll be the first to crush you, <color=red>Thunderfire Gang</color>!)
虽然<color=red>雷火门</color>已经覆灭，大仇得报，但不知为什么你的心境并未通达。¤Although the <color=red>Thunderfire Gang</color> has been destroyed and revenge has been taken, for some reason your mind is not clear。
回想起本派踏平<color=red>雷火门</color>时的情景，恐怕当初<color=red>飞云门</color>被覆灭之时，也是如此这般。¤When I think back to the time when our school crushed the <color=red>Thunderfire Clan</color>, I'm afraid it was the same when the <color=red>Flying Cloud Clan</color> was destroyed。
江湖恩怨，相互厮杀，<color=red>雷火门</color>与<color=red>飞云门</color>的下场，这江湖上时时刻刻都在上演。¤The fate of the <color=red>Thunderfire Sect</color> and the <color=red>Flying Cloud Sect</color> is being played out all the time in the jianghu。
不知本派是否也会有一天...¤I wonder if our school will one day...
不行！我绝对不能让这一幕再在本门上演！¤No! I absolutely cannot let this scene play out in our sect again!
你召集门派所有弟子来到主厅。¤You summon all disciples of the sect to the main hall。
今日本掌门要宣布一件事情。¤Today, our master will make an announcement。
虽然雷火帮已经覆灭，但是江湖上尔虞我诈，我们依然不能有任何松懈。¤Although the Thunder Fire Gang has been destroyed, but in the jianghu, we still can not have any laxity。
只有成为了这个江湖中的主宰，命运才能掌握在自己的手中！¤Only when we become the master of this jianghu, can our fate be in our own hands!
从今以后，本门的目标就是要一统江湖！¤From now on, the goal of our sect is to unify the rivers and lakes!
哪怕在我有生之年无法达成，所有继任的掌门也当以此为目标！¤Even if I can't achieve it in my lifetime, all the succeeding disciples should aim for it!
说完之后，众弟子山呼海啸一般沸腾，纷纷表示要努力成为下任掌门，带领门派一统江湖。¤After saying this, the disciples boiled like a tsunami, saying that they would strive to become the next Sect Leader and lead the sect to unify the rivers and lakes。
门派所有弟子<color=red>属性资质提升、心情提升、忠诚提升</color>。¤All the disciples of the sect had their <color=red>attribute qualifications raised, their mood raised, and their loyalty raised</color>。
还是没办法与<color=red>雷火帮</color>的势力抗衡吗！¤Still no way to fight against the power of <color=red>Thunderfire Gang</color>!
短短10年就想覆灭<color=red>雷火帮</color>，我真的是太天真了。¤To try to overthrow <color=red>Thunderfire Gang</color> in just 10 years, I am really too naive。
江湖纷争，我已经感到厌倦；从此我将退隐江湖，做回一个普通人。¤I am tired of the strife in the Jianghu Lake; from now on I will retire from the Jianghu Lake and become an ordinary person。
我将留下自己多年的<color=red>武学心得</color>，以便让继任者有能力继续壮大本门。¤I will leave behind my years of <color=red>martial arts experience</color> so that my successor will have the ability to continue to grow our clan。
至于掌门之位，就由你们自行推选一位吧。¤As for the position of Sect Leader, you will be able to choose one yourselves。
说完之后，便独自离开了门派，萧瑟的背影之下，当初的雄心壮志荡然无存，众弟子知道已无挽留的必要了。¤After saying that, he left the sect alone, his ambition gone under his sullen back, and the disciples knew that there was no need to stay。
这批货送到酬劳不菲,大伙加把劲！¤We'll pay you well for this shipment, let's go!
前方开道的护卫注意安全,当心盗匪！¤Watch out for the guards in the front。 Beware of the bandits!
谁敢惹事的,兄弟们不必留手！¤Anyone who dares to cause trouble, we don't have to hold back!
我们是运送货物的商队,阁下有事吗?¤We are a caravan of goods。 What do you want?
原来如此,您看看想交易点什么。¤I see。 Let's see what you want to trade。
您一共<color=#E73434>支出{0}</color>,<color=#21B330>收入{1}</color>。¤You have a total of <color=#E73434>expenses</color>, <color=#21B330>income{1}</color>。
你的钱不够！¤You don't have enough money!
交易愉快。¤Happy trading。
我们商队的货,可不是哪里都能买到的。¤Our merchants' goods are not available anywhere。
青山不改,绿水长流;大侠慢走。¤The green mountains do not change, the green water flows; take care, warrior。
朋友,我们还要赶路,你还有什么要买的,自己去城里吧！¤My friend, we have to hurry, what else do you want to buy, go to the city yourself!
