### Installation Instructions
Switching to the stable branch from the default branch is mandatory as of now to use this translation mod. We currently only support the stable version of the game. Follow the instructions below to see how to change your game to the stable branch.
#### Part 1 - Switching your game to the Stable branch (MANDATORY)
1. Open Steam and go to your Steam library. Install the game if you haven't yet, then right click it and select "Properties" 
2. In the left panel of the properties window select "BETAS" 
3. There will be a drop down menu under "Select the beta you want to opt into:". Click the dropdown arrow to the right and select "stable - Stable branch" 
4. That's it, you're now on the stable branch of the game and can proceed to follow the instructions below to install the translation mod.

#### Part 2 - Installing the Translation Patch
1. Backup your game folder if you don't want to have to verify files using Steam in case things go wrong. 
2. Download the translation mod files (see Downloads section) 
3. Copy these files to your root game folder (i.e. : .\Steam\steamapps\common\大衍江湖), overwrite when prompted. 
4. Run SetupReiPatcherAndAutoTranslator.exe [Note : XUnity is used as a framework for text replacement at runtime. Autotranslation features have never been used and are turned off. They should remain that way.] 
5. Launch the EvolutionOfJiangHu (Patch and Run) shorcut 
6. Done! You will need to use this shortcut whenever you want to play. 
### ADVANCED (optional) - Compiling the Mod for any version of the game
Please ignore this section if you just want to play the game and the mod is already updated for the current version of the game. 

This section will provide information on how to manually compile the mod using your own game files, allowing anyone to update the translation mod to the current game version in case if for some reason this mod is no longer being maintained or updated anymore (I am currently the sole maintainer! I'm looking for helpers).
