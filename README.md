We are also looking for volunteers to help out with this mod and some of our other projects! Let us know if you're interested in helping out. For this game in particular we are looking for guide writers, and others to help maintain this mod. Anyone can help out with the guides or submit their own on the discord, we appreciate anything anyone wants to submit, big or small.

Follow the instructions below and see how to change your game to the stable branch.
#### Part 1 - Switching your game to the Stable branch (MANDATORY)

2. In the left panel of the properties window select "BETAS" 
3. There will be a drop-down menu under "Select the beta you want to opt into:". Click the drop-down arrow to the right and select "stable - Stable branch"

#### Part 2 - Installing the Translation Patch
1. Backup your game folder if you don't want to have to verify files using Steam in case things go wrong. 
2. Download the translation mod files (see Downloads section) 
3. Copy these files to your root game folder (i.e.: .\Steam\steamapps\common\大衍江湖), and overwrite when prompted. 
4. Run SetupReiPatcherAndAutoTranslator.exe [Note: XUnity is used as a framework for text replacement at runtime. Autotranslation features have never been used and are turned off. They should remain that way.] 
5. Launch the EvolutionOfJiangHu (Patch and Run) shortcut 
6. Done! You will need to use this shortcut whenever you want to play.
